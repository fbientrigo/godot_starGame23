Maybe if you photograph the same object with different filters, in astronomy it's common to use filters with a narrow passband to only allow frequencies that you need

 - Ultraviolet (u)
 - Opticals (b,g,r)
 - Near Infrarred (i)
 - Infrarred (z)

With this information you are adding dimensions to your image, it becomes a matrix with 3 dimension; 
in first 2 axis you construct an standalone image b&w image, with ultraviolet brightness; with blue, green, red in the next ones and so on.
